                So You Wanna Be A Programmer?

            <p>
                Getting started with programming can either be super simple for some, or very confusing for others.<br>
                Because of that, this website serves as a resource for any lost sheep that need to be pointed in the<br>
                right direction, or anyone that may be interested/curious about it.<br><br>

                <span class='head'>Disclaimers</span> <span class='body'>to the curious passerby's; this website is not a tutorial. It's a resource.</span><br>
