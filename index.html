                    Understanding Being a Developer
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Being a "developer" in the tech industry is a pretty broad term. Its meaning can vary from being QA<br>
                    (Quality Assurance) testers, to being a full-stack developer, to being a DevOps engineer, to being a<br>
                    Cyber Security Analyst, etc. The list is extensive and could go on forever. Understanding your role in<br>
                    the tech industry is important when you want to get involved or are trying to decide where it is that<br>
                    you want to be in the long run. It's also important to understand the differences between the roles and<br>
                    what they entail.
